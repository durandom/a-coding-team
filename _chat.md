It can also connect to local models, providing flexibility in development environments. aider.chatIDE Integration: Aider can be used within various Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), allowing developers to incorporate AI assistance into their preferred coding environment. aider.chatVoice-to-Code Functionality: Developers can input code modifications using voice commands, enhancing accessibility and convenience. aider.chatLimitations:Context Management: Providing too much irrelevant code can overwhelm the LLM, leading to confusion. It's recommended to add only the files that need modification to the chat. aider.chatLarge Repository Performance: While Aider can operate within large repositories, performance may be affected. Strategies like focusing on specific subdirectories or using an .aiderignore file can help manage this. aider.chatChat History Limitations: Extensive chat histories can consume significant tokens and may lead to confusion in the LLM's responses. Limiting the chat history sent to the LLM can mitigate this issue. github.comModel Dependency: The quality of assistance is contingent on the connected LLM. Some models may perform better than others, and certain tasks might require specific models for optimal results. aider.chatAutomatic Commit Management: While automatic commits are a feature, they can clutter the commit history if not managed properly. Developers should review and possibly disable this feature based on their workflow preferences. doubledotdevelopment.co.ukIn summary, Aider offers a robust set of features to enhance the development process through AI-assisted coding. However, mindful integration and management are essential to fully leverage its capabilities while mitigating potential limitations.Sources

Human: It also doesn't have access to any external tools. I mean, it can search the web, but if we want to track issues and process, we don't have access to GitHub Issues or JIRA, but we need to replicate this flow on the file system. Second, it has a repository map, which means it knows about all files in the repository, but it doesn't necessarily know about the content of all files. So, if we are tracking the state of certain issues and the flow of certain issues, maybe it's better to reflect that in the file name rather than in the content of those files.

ChatGPT: Yes, that's a crucial insight. If we want to replicate a structured development process inside a repository without access to external tools like GitHub Issues or JIRA, we need to track everything within the file system. Based on Aider’s capabilities and limitations, here are some key takeaways for designing our workflow:1. Tracking Issues in the File SystemSince Aider can search files and understand file structures but doesn’t have real-time access to external issue-tracking tools, we should structure issue tracking in a way that:Makes issue states explicit in filenames (so Aider can easily recognize them).Uses directories to organize issues by status rather than storing everything in a single file.Minimizes unnecessary content inside files, since Aider may not remember their contents unless explicitly added.Possible Issue Tracking File System LayoutbashCopyEdit/issues
  ├── todo/
  │   ├── 001_add_login_form.todo.md
  │   ├── 002_fix_sidebar_bug.todo.md
  │
  ├── in-progress/
  │   ├── 001_add_login_form.in-progress.md
  │
  ├── done/
  │   ├── 002_fix_sidebar_bug.done.md
Each issue gets a unique numeric prefix for easy tracking.The file extension (.todo.md, .in-progress.md, .done.md) represents the state, making it easy for Aider to process.Moving a file between folders changes its status (e.g., mv issues/todo/001_add_login_form.todo.md issues/in-progress/).If an issue involves multiple files, they can be referenced inside the .md file.2. Managing the Development FlowSince Aider has a repository map, but not necessarily full content awareness, we can optimize how we manage tasks:Keep the repository map clean by only involving files that need modification.Avoid long, complex content inside tracking files because Aider might lose track of their state.Reflect key state changes in file names instead of inside the files to improve Aider’s ability to parse changes.Example FlowNew Task → Create a file in /issues/todo/bashCopyEdittouch issues/todo/003_refactor_auth_system.todo.md
Start Working on It → Move to /issues/in-progress/bashCopyEditmv issues/todo/003_refactor_auth_system.todo.md issues/in-progress/
Complete It → Move to /issues/done/bashCopyEditmv issues/in-progress/003_refactor_auth_system.in-progress.md issues/done/
3. Automating Progress with Git CommitsSince Aider commits automatically, we can integrate this workflow into Git:Every state change (moving a file) can be automatically committed:sqlCopyEditgit add issues/
git commit -m "Issue #003 moved to in-progress"
If we use pre-commit hooks, we could enforce rules (e.g., preventing commits if there are todo tasks).4. Keeping Aider Aware of the ProcessPeriodically remind Aider to check the /issues/ directory for updates.When discussing tasks, use filenames explicitly to force Aider to remember context:vbnetCopyEditaider: "Let's work on `003_refactor_auth_system.in-progress.md` next."
If Aider gets confused, explicitly re-add relevant files using:bashCopyEditaider add issues/in-progress/003_refactor_auth_system.in-progress.md
SummaryNo external tracking tools → We track issues in the file system.Aider has a repository map but limited file content awareness → Use filenames and directory structure to reflect state.Use a simple file-based Kanban (/issues/todo/, /in-progress/, /done/).Leverage Git for tracking movements and automate commits.Explicitly keep Aider aware of the flow by mentioning relevant files.This setup should allow us to replicate a structured development process inside Aider while staying within its constraints.

Human: When working on a larger project, we need to have certain roles, like a product manager defining the features and planning out a roadmap, then a software architect doing architectural decision records and diagrams, etc. and then software engineers doing the implementation and tests, and then maybe a UI and UX person responsible for creating designs and mock-ups. When working, we should have clear handovers from these personas, and I want to implement an agent-driven workflow with Ada, so whenever we assume a certain role, we can prime the AI model with a system prompt, and for that we need to have clear input and output criterias.

ChatGPT: That makes a lot of sense. If we're going to implement an agent-driven workflow with Ada, we need a clear handover process between different personas, structured inputs and outputs, and a way to prime the AI model with system prompts based on roles.1. Defining the Roles & ResponsibilitiesWe should define each role's responsibilities, inputs, and expected outputs to ensure smooth handovers.Roles in the Development ProcessRoleResponsibilitiesInputsOutputsProduct Manager (PM)Defines features, roadmap, user storiesBusiness needs, user feedback, market researchFeature documents, prioritized roadmap, user storiesSoftware ArchitectDesigns system architecture, APIs, tech stackFeature documents, existing system constraintsArchitectural Decision Records (ADRs), system diagrams, API specsSoftware EngineerImplements features, writes tests, integrates APIsADRs, API specs, user storiesCode, unit tests, documentation, PRsUI/UX DesignerCreates wireframes, prototypes, mock-upsUser stories, product goalsFigma designs, CSS/UI component guidelinesQA EngineerTests features, writes automated and manual testsUser stories, test plansBug reports, test cases, test automation scriptsEach role needs a system prompt template when switching roles in Ada to ensure correct behavior.2. Structuring the Workflow with Handover FilesSince Aider (and similar AI-driven workflows) works best with file-based tracking, we should enforce structured inputs and outputs as handover files.Folder Structure for Role-Based HandoverbashCopyEdit/project

Each step requires a formal handover (i.e., files must exist before proceeding).Aider should only focus on files relevant to the current persona to avoid context overload.Handover files can be stored in a /handover/ folder to automate transitions.3. Priming the AI Model for Role-Based WorkflowsWhen assuming a role, Ada should be primed with a system prompt containing:The current role's responsibilitiesThe expected inputsThe expected outputsRules for decision-making & focus scopeExample System Prompts1.

4. Automating Transitions Between RolesWe can make switching roles easier by:Using a script to update Ada’s system prompt when assuming a new role.Auto-generating missing handover files using AI assistance.Example shell script for switching roles:shCopyEdit#!/bin/bash
ROLE=$1
case "$ROLE" in
  "pm") echo "Switching to Product Manager"; cat prompts/pm.txt > .ada_prompt ;;
  "architect") echo "Switching to Software Architect"; cat prompts/architect.txt > .ada_prompt ;;
  "engineer") echo "Switching to Software Engineer"; cat prompts/engineer.txt > .ada_prompt ;;
  "designer") echo "Switching to UI/UX Designer"; cat prompts/designer.txt > .ada_prompt ;;
  "qa") echo "Switching to QA Engineer"; cat prompts/qa.txt > .ada_prompt ;;
  *) echo "Invalid role" ;;
esac
Usage:shCopyEdit./switch_role.sh engineer
This will update Ada’s system prompt to match the new role.5. Ensuring Process DisciplineAutomated validation: Ensure no role can proceed unless all required handover files exist.Naming conventions: Consistent file structures for easy tracking.Git enforcement: Prevent merging incomplete work without necessary handover files.SummaryAgent-driven development with Ada requires structured inputs and outputs per role.A file-based handover process ensures clarity and tracks progress.A system prompt per role ensures Ada understands responsibilities and focuses correctly.Automating role switching with a script simplifies workflow transitions.This approach mimics real-world collaboration while working within Ada’s constraints.

Human: We also need to track the evolution and the overall state of the system in one or maybe many files, because since Ada doesn't know everything about the state of the application, I think with every step in the evolution we want to have something like a changelog and also something like maybe another file which is like an overall architecture overview for the architect, then several feature overviews for the software developers, and another file for the UX person, like one larger UI overview, so on the handover, or let's say at the boundaries, so when we have a definition, we need to have a definition of done whenever a task leaves a certain persona, and that definition of done needs to include the update of these files.

ChatGPT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Since Ada doesn’t retain full knowledge of the system, we need persistent state-tracking files that capture the evolution of the system at different levels. These files should be updated at every major step in the workflow, ensuring that handovers include all necessary context for the next persona.1. Defining the Core System State FilesTo maintain a single source of truth for different aspects of the project, we should maintain structured documentation files:File NamePurposeUpdated ByCHANGELOG.mdLogs every major change (new features, fixes, architectural changes)Every role when completing a taskARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.mdHigh-level architecture, system components, APIs, dependenciesSoftware ArchitectFEATURE_OVERVIEW.mdSummarizes existing and upcoming featuresProduct ManagerUI_OVERVIEW.mdTracks UI components, design principles, and user flowsUI/UX DesignerQA_OVERVIEW.mdTracks test coverage, known issues, test plansQA EngineerEach of these files should be updated whenever a task is completed. The update is part of the definition of done (DoD) for each role before handover.2. Enforcing the Definition of Done (DoD)For smooth handovers, we define checklists for each role that must be completed before transitioning a task.Definition of Done for Each Persona✅ Product Manager (PM) Feature has a clear user story in FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md Feature is listed in the roadmap (roadmap/) User requirements are clear and documented The feature is ready for architectural review✅ Software Architect Feature is technically defined in ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md Relevant ADR (Architectural Decision Record) is created If applicable, system diagrams are updated API specifications are documented✅ UI/UX Designer Feature is visually designed and added to UI_OVERVIEW.md Wireframes, mockups, or prototypes are completed Accessibility guidelines are reviewed✅ Software Engineer Feature is implemented and tested Unit tests exist and pass Code is documented where needed CHANGELOG.md is updated with implementation details✅ QA Engineer Feature has a test plan in QA_OVERVIEW.md Automated tests are written if required Any bugs found are tracked in /qa/ Feature is marked ready for deployment🚨 Before a task is considered "done," all relevant overview files must be updated!3. Implementing the Workflow in the File SystemSince we need to track both evolution (changelog) and the current state (overviews), we can structure it like this:bashCopyEdit/docs
  ├── CHANGELOG.md  # Logs all major system changes
  ├── ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md  # System architecture, APIs, tech stack
  ├── FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md  # Active features, planned features
  ├── UI_OVERVIEW.md  # Design principles, UI components, user flows
  ├── QA_OVERVIEW.md  # Test strategy, known issues, automation coverage
These files serve as the backbone of our documentation, ensuring all roles have visibility.4. Automating Documentation UpdatesSince manual updates are error-prone, we should integrate commit hooks or scripts to enforce updates.Git Pre-Commit Hook to Enforce Documentation UpdatesWe can create a pre-commit hook that prevents commits if certain files are not updated when required.Create .git/hooks/pre-commit:shCopyEdit#!/bin/bash

# List of required documentation files
REQUIRED_FILES=("docs/CHANGELOG.md" "docs/FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md" "docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md")

# Check if required files have been modified in this commit
for file in "${REQUIRED_FILES[@]}"; do
  if ! git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "$file"; then
    echo "🚨 ERROR: $file must be updated before committing!"
    exit 1
  fi
done

exit 0
Make it executable:shCopyEditchmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
Now, if someone tries to commit without updating at least one of the required files, Git will block the commit.5. Automating Role TransitionsWe can integrate Ada role-switching with documentation updates.Example shell script:shCopyEdit#!/bin/bash

ROLE=$1

echo "Switching role to $ROLE"

case "$ROLE" in
  "pm") cat prompts/pm.txt > .ada_prompt ;;
  "architect") cat prompts/architect.txt > .ada_prompt ;;
  "designer") cat prompts/designer.txt > .ada_prompt ;;
  "engineer") cat prompts/engineer.txt > .ada_prompt ;;
  "qa") cat prompts/qa.txt > .ada_prompt ;;
  *) echo "Invalid role"; exit 1 ;;
esac

# Automatically open relevant overview file
case "$ROLE" in
  "pm") nano docs/FEATURE_OVERVIEW.md ;;
  "architect") nano docs/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md ;;
  "designer") nano docs/UI_OVERVIEW.md ;;
  "engineer") nano docs/CHANGELOG.md ;;
  "qa") nano docs/QA_OVERVIEW.md ;;
esac

echo "✅ Role switched to $ROLE. Please update the relevant documentation."
Now, when a team member switches roles, they’re immediately reminded to update documentation.Usage:shCopyEdit./switch_role.sh engineer
This will:Update Ada's system prompt.Open the corresponding overview file in a text editor.Ensure documentation stays up to date before continuing work.6. SummaryWe need persistent state-tracking files (CHANGELOG.md, ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md, etc.).Each role has a "Definition of Done" checklist that requires updating these files.File system structure keeps project evolution and current state well-documented.Automated Git hooks prevent missing updates in key documentation files.Role-switching scripts enforce Ada priming and documentation updates.🚀 With this system, we ensure:✅ Ada always has context✅ Roles hand over tasks smoothly✅ Nothing is left undocumented✅ The system evolves transparentlyThis keeps the AI-driven workflow structured, traceable, and effective!
