- stop after working on the first epic / task  or item in your backlog
- the number of epcis / tasks should not be limited to a specific number, use your best judgement. it can be 1 or or many.
- the team lead should also keep the tasks in pending status until the team has finished, so that the team lead can review the tasks and accept them.
- the UXD role should be more clear - they should not be working on code.
- before reading the code, the engineer should read the previous tasks in that epic to understand how they've been implemented. That's in the completion summary and completed log.
- move the completed log to the subfolder of the epic
